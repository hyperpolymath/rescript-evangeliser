> *Celebrate good, minimize bad, show better* — A pattern library and educational toolkit that teaches JavaScript developers ReScript through progressive code transformation, without shame.

== What is This?

ReScript Evangeliser is a library and toolkit that helps JavaScript developers learn ReScript by:

* 🔍 *Detecting patterns* in existing JS code
* 🔄 *Showing transformations* to equivalent ReScript code
* 💬 *Explaining with encouragement* using the "You were close!" philosophy
* 📊 *Visualizing concepts* with Makaton-inspired glyphs
* 🎯 *Progressive disclosure* through 4 view layers (RAW → FOLDED → GLYPHED → WYSIWYG)

*We never shame developers.* Your JavaScript is good! ReScript just makes some things even better.

== Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

* https://deno.land[Deno] (latest stable)
* https://rescript-lang.org[ReScript] 11+

=== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/rescript-evangeliser.git
cd rescript-evangeliser

# Install dependencies
just install

# Build ReScript sources
just build

# Run validation
just validate
----

=== Development

[source,bash]
----
# Watch mode for development
just watch

# Run tests
just test

# Format code

== Features

=== 50+ Transformation Patterns

Categories include:

* Null safety → Option types
* Async/await → Promise types
* Try/catch → Result types
* Array operations → Pipe operator
* Conditionals → Pattern matching
* OOP → Functional programming
* Classes → Records
* And many more!

=== Four View Layers

1. *RAW*: Side-by-side JavaScript/ReScript comparison with narrative
2. *FOLDED*: Organized sections with collapsible regions
3. *GLYPHED*: Symbol-annotated code showing semantic meaning
4. *WYSIWYG*: Block-based visual editor (coming soon)

=== Makaton-Inspired Glyphs

Visual symbols that transcend syntax:

* 🛡️ Shield (null safety)
* 🔄 Transform (data transformation)
* ➡️ Flow (pipe operator)
* 🌿 Branch (pattern matching)
* 💎 Crystal (immutability)
* And 16 more!

== Technology Stack

=== Primary Technologies

* *ReScript*: Core application logic (Types, Patterns, Glyphs, Narrative)
* *Deno*: Runtime, package management, build scripts
* *Nickel*: Type-safe configuration

=== Language Policy

Per Hyperpolymath Standard:

[cols="2,3"]
|===
|*Allowed* |*Banned*

|ReScript |TypeScript
|Deno |Node.js/npm/bun
|justfile |Makefile
|Nickel |YAML/JSON for config
|===

== Philosophy: "Celebrate Good, Minimize Bad, Show Better"

We *never* shame developers. Instead:

1. *Celebrate*: Recognize what their JavaScript does well
2. *Minimize*: Gently acknowledge minor limitations
3. *Better*: Show how ReScript enhances the pattern
4. *Safety*: Explain type-level guarantees
5. *Example*: Provide concrete, encouraging examples

Example narrative:

____
✨ *You were close!* You're already thinking about null and undefined - that's great defensive programming!

💭 The only small thing is that it's easy to forget one of these checks somewhere...

🚀 *Even better:* ReScript's Option type makes null safety automatic - you literally can't forget a check!
____
