> *Celebrate good, minimize bad, show better* — A VS Code extension that teaches JavaScript developers ReScript through progressive code transformation, without shame.

== What is This?

ReScript Evangeliser is a VS Code extension that helps JavaScript/TypeScript developers learn ReScript by:

- 🔍 *Detecting patterns* in your existing JS/TS code
- 🔄 *Showing transformations* to equivalent ReScript code
- 💬 *Explaining with encouragement* using the "You were close!" philosophy
- 📊 *Visualizing concepts* with Makaton-inspired glyphs
- 🎯 *Progressive disclosure* through 4 view layers (RAW → FOLDED → GLYPHED → WYSIWYG)

*We never shame developers.* Your JavaScript is good! ReScript just makes some things even better.

== Quick Start

=== Installation

```bash
= Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/rescript-evangeliser.git
cd rescript-evangeliser/extension

= Install dependencies (zero external runtime dependencies for the extension itself)
npm install

= Compile
npm run compile

= Run tests
npm test

= Launch in VS Code
= Press F5 or Run > Start Debugging
```

=== Usage

1. Open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac) to transform selected code
3. Or use Command Palette: `ReScript: Show Transformation Panel`
4. Explore 50+ patterns across 4 view layers!

== Features

=== 50+ Transformation Patterns

Categories include:
- Null safety → Option types
- Async/await → Promise types
- Try/catch → Result types
- Array operations → Pipe operator
- Conditionals → Pattern matching
- OOP → Functional programming
- Classes → Records
- And many more!

=== Four View Layers

1. *RAW*: Side-by-side JavaScript/ReScript comparison with narrative
2. *FOLDED*: Organized sections with collapsible regions
3. *GLYPHED*: Symbol-annotated code showing semantic meaning
4. *WYSIWYG*: Block-based visual editor (coming soon)

=== Makaton-Inspired Glyphs

Visual symbols that transcend syntax:
- 🛡️ Shield (null safety)
- 🔄 Transform (data transformation)
- ➡️ Flow (pipe operator)
- 🌿 Branch (pattern matching)
- 💎 Crystal (immutability)
- And 16 more!

== RSR Compliance

This project follows the *Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR)* framework:

- ✅ *Type Safety*: TypeScript with strict mode, ReScript examples
- ✅ *Offline First*: Zero network dependencies, works air-gapped
- ✅ *Complete Documentation*: See [docs/](docs/)
- ✅ *Security First*: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- ✅ *Open Governance*: TPCF Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)
- ✅ *Dual Licensed*: MIT + Palimpsest v0.8
- ✅ *100% Test Coverage*: `npm test` to verify
- ✅ *Build Reproducibility*: Nix flake included

See [RSR_COMPLIANCE.md](docs/RSR_COMPLIANCE.md) for full details.

== TPCF: Community Sandbox (Perimeter 3)

This project uses the *Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework*:

- *Perimeter 3*: Fully open to community contributions
- No approval required for pull requests (automated review)
- Community-driven governance
- See [TPCF.md](docs/TPCF.md) for details

== Philosophy: "Celebrate Good, Minimize Bad, Show Better"

We *never* shame developers. Instead:

1. *Celebrate*: Recognize what their JavaScript does well
2. *Minimize*: Gently acknowledge minor limitations
3. *Better*: Show how ReScript enhances the pattern
4. *Safety*: Explain type-level guarantees
5. *Example*: Provide concrete, encouraging examples

Example narrative:
> ✨ *You were close!* You're already thinking about null and undefined - that's great defensive programming!
>
> 💭 The only small thing is that it's easy to forget one of these checks somewhere...
>
> 🚀 *Even better:* ReScript's Option type makes null safety automatic - you literally can't forget a check!

== Architecture

=== Offline-First Design

- *Zero network dependencies* at runtime
- All patterns stored locally
- Works in air-gapped environments
- No telemetry without explicit opt-in (privacy-preserving)

=== Performance Targets

- ⚡ <300ms pattern detection
- 💾 <100MB memory usage
- 🚀 <50ms UI response time
- All targets *exceeded* in current build (50-100ms typical)

=== Technology Stack

- *TypeScript*: VS Code extension development
- *Babel Parser*: AST-based pattern matching
- *ReScript*: Example transformations
- *No external runtime dependencies*: Self-contained
